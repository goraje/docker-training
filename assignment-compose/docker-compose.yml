services:
  # Add necessary services named: reverseproxy, nginx, apache.

  # The reverseproxy service should use the custom-built reverseproxy image
  # and map ports 8080 -> 8080 and 8081 -> 8081. The restart policy should be 
  # set to "always".

  # The nginx service should depend on reverseproxy and use the nginx:alpine image.
  # Restart policy set to "always".
  
  # The apache service should depend on reverseproxy and use the httpd:alpine image.
  # Restart policy set to "always"
